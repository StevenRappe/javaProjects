Project: MapSort

Description:
	Creates a hashmap of objects that hold a key (the unique character)
	and a value (the number of occurrences). Then it stores these map
	objects in a priority queue based on the objects' respective values.
	Finally it displays the contents of the priority queue.

Files:
	Map: creates the hashmap and the priority queue, and executes main method.
	Node: the node class that each object uses. Has getKey() and getValue() methods.
	
Execution:
	Run file titled "Map".
	The program will ask the user to enter a string to be hashed.
	Then the program will run independently, displaying the ordering
		of the priority queue.
