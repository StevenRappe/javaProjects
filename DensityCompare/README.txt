Project: DensityCompare

Description:
	Creates a dense array of type double and a sparse array of type double.
	
Files:
	ArrayCompare: Holds methods to create both dense and sparse lists as well as
		compute the sum of their respective elements. Also contains the main
		method that collects user input specifications and displays results.
		
Execution:
	Program first asks the user to enter an integer array length. 
	Then the user must enter a sparse array density of type double
		between 0.0 and 1.0.
	Program then computes sums and displays results.
